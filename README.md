# Comparative evaluation of bacterial pan-genome analysis tools
## Master's Thesis of Benjamin Otter

This repository contains a collection of scripts I used for data generation and data analysis during my Master's Thesis. It is organized in 4 subfolders:

### data generation
- nextflow `.nf` scripts for data generation
- conda environment `.yml` files

### benchmark
- nextflow `.nf` scripts to run each tool
- format scripts for each tool
- conda environment `.yml` files

### results analysis
- formatted output files `.json` of all runs
- IPython notebooks `.ipynb` used to generate plots for each bacterial species
- additional analysis scripts `.py`

### results benchmark
- raw benchmark data `.txt` trace files
- IPython notebooks `.ipynb` used to compute and plot benchmark results
- additional scripts
